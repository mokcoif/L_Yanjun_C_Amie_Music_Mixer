# Music Mixer Assignment
## by Amie C and Yanjun L

The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and
ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools
as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop
functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger
animation, and play a compiled audio track (see www.incredibox.com as a
reference).

Try to implement this project in sprints - part of an agile workflow best practice. A
sprint consists of a scoped mini-project that focuses on one particular deliverable or
feature. The work you do lives on a specific branch; everything required to complete
that deliverable is done on that branch and then merged to the master branch
when finished.
Then it’s on to the next sprint

Sprint 1: Setup, analysis and initial design
Set up the github repo with a readme (make sure this more than just the project
name - refer to readme examples online). BOTH team members should be
contributing at this point - the designer can create the layout, generate the html and
the css; the developer should be researching functionality, creating JavaScript files,
updating the HTML to add classes or other tools you might need to make things
work. Testing events, loading audio, etc can all happen here - it doesn’t have to be
final but you should have an idea of how you want things to work, how you want it
to look and start designing, testing and experimenting. 

Sprint 2: drag and drop, audio, design improvements
Implement drag and drop functionality; get your audio synced and playback
working. Designers should be replacing any FPO (for position only) assets with real
artwork and doing any other design changes that need to be finished.

Sprint 3: final touches / improvements
At this point you should be crushing any final bugs that pop up, doing any final
design tweaks, and lots of testing / fixing. Responsive fixes would occur here as
well - make sure you’re testing on lots of different screen sizes.
